# web-cache-poison — Web Cache Poisoning

## Unkeyed Header Attack

Headers absent from the cache key but reflected into responses control content for all subsequent users who hit the cached entry.

### Common Unkeyed Headers

| Header                  | Effect when unkeyed and reflected                  |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `X-Forwarded-Host`     | Controls redirects, canonical links, script `src` |
| `X-Original-URL`       | Alternate path override at the back-end            |
| `X-Rewrite-URL`        | Alternate path override at the back-end            |
| `X-Forwarded-Scheme`   | Forces `http://` in redirects                      |
| `X-Forwarded-Port`     | Alters port in generated links                     |

### Discovery

```bash
curl -H "X-Forwarded-Host: attacker.com" https://target.com/ -v
# If response body contains attacker.com → unkeyed header confirmed
```

Tool: **Burp Param Miner** → "Guess headers" — scans hundreds of headers automatically.

### Exploit Chain

1. Confirm unkeyed header controls a `<script src>`, `<link>`, redirect target, or similar.
2. Point header to `attacker.com/evil.js`.
3. Identify a cacheable URL (static-looking path, no personal data in response, cache headers present).
4. Send poisoned request to that URL without a cache buster → response stored.
5. Victim requests same URL → receives cached response loading `evil.js`.

## Web Cache Deception (WCD)

### Conditions

- CDN caches by file extension (`.css`, `.js`, `.jpg`, etc.)
- Back-end ignores the extension and serves the authenticated endpoint's content regardless.

### Attack

Send victim to:
```
https://target.com/account/settings.css
```
CDN caches the response (classified as static asset). Attacker fetches the same URL unauthenticated — receives victim's authenticated page content from cache.

## Cache Path Normalization

### Mechanism

CDN normalizes `%2F` → `/` for its cache key lookup.  
Back-end receives the raw encoded path and resolves it differently.

### Attack

```
GET /evil%2F../settings.css HTTP/1.1
```
- CDN cache key: `/settings.css`  
- Back-end sees: `/evil%2F../settings.css` → resolves to attacker-controlled content  
- Cached as `/settings.css` for all subsequent users

### Conditions

- CDN performs URL decode/normalization before keying
- Back-end does not normalize the same way

## Exploitation Workflow

1. Run Burp Param Miner against target to find unkeyed headers.
2. Test each for reflection in response body (script src, redirect, canonical).
3. For WCD: probe paths with extension suffixes on authenticated endpoints.
4. For path normalization: fuzz `%2F`, `%2f`, `%5C`, `..%2F` variants.
5. Confirm cache storage via `Age:` / `X-Cache: HIT` response headers.
6. Deliver payload URL to victim (phishing, XSS, open redirect chain).
