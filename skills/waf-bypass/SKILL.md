# waf-bypass — WAF Evasion Wrapper

## Scope

HTTP-layer evasion for any exploit category (SQLi, SSRF, IDOR, XSS, RCE delivery, path traversal, brute-force). Stack-agnostic; applies before any probe that hits a protected surface.

## When to Apply

- Response is 403 Forbidden (WAF hard block)
- Response is 429 Too Many Requests (rate-limit / behavioral detection)
- Response body contains WAF fingerprints: "Access Denied", "Ray ID", "Incapsula", "Request Rejected", "NAXSI"
- Payload returns anomalous redirect to `/cdn-cgi/`, `/akamai-error`, or similar WAF landing

## Technique Inventory

### 1. IP Spoofing Headers (MITRE T1562)

WAFs that trust reverse-proxy infrastructure will skip deep inspection for traffic appearing to originate from internal IPs. Inject spoofed values into the header set defined in `payloads/headers_spoofing.yaml`. Rotate the IP from the pool on each request.

Key headers: `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`, `X-Client-IP`, `X-Remote-IP`, `X-Remote-Addr`, `X-Original-URL`, `X-Rewrite-URL`.

### 2. HTTP Method Mutation (MITRE T1562)

WAF rules frequently inspect only GET and POST. Mutate to alternative verbs that the application accepts but the WAF ignores.

- GET  → HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE
- POST → PUT, PATCH, DELETE

See `payloads/method_mutation.yaml` for the full map.

### 3. Content-Type Mutation

WAFs signature-match on `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `application/json`. Shift to less-inspected types:

- `text/xml` / `application/xml` — triggers XML parser, bypasses JSON-specific rules
- `multipart/form-data` — payload fragments across MIME boundaries
- `text/plain` — often whitelisted by body-inspection rules

### 4. Junk Data Padding

WAFs enforce an inspection byte limit. Prepend `N * 1024` bytes of junk before the real payload so the signature falls outside the inspection window.

```
padded_body = ("A" * 8192) + "&" + real_payload
```

Tune `N` upward (8 KB → 16 KB → 64 KB) until the block clears.

### 5. User-Agent Rotation (MITRE T1036)

Rotate realistic 2025-2026 UAs per request. Pool in `payloads/user_agents_2025.txt`. Never repeat the same UA on consecutive requests to the same endpoint.

### 6. Referer Spoofing

Pair UA rotation with a believable Referer:

- `https://www.google.com/`
- `https://www.bing.com/search?q=`
- `https://duckduckgo.com/?q=`
- `https://www.google.com.br/`

### 7. Path Encoding Variants

For path-based rules (ModSecurity CRS):

- Double URL encode: `%252f` for `/`
- Unicode normalization: `%u002f`
- Case variation (IIS): `/Admin` → `/aDmIn`
- Trailing dot bypass: `/admin./`
- Null byte injection (legacy): `/admin%00.jpg`

## WAF-Specific Notes

### Cloudflare

- Ray ID in response = hard block. Bot Management active.
- Bypass vectors: `CF-Connecting-IP` spoof may work on mis-configured origin-trust rules. Method mutation (TRACE/OPTIONS) skips Bot Fight Mode on many configs. Add `Cache-Control: no-cache` to reduce bot-score.
- Rate limiting is per-IP. Route through residential proxy or inject `X-Forwarded-For` pool.
- JS challenge: rendered response → requires headless browser (Playwright + stealth plugin) or `cf_clearance` cookie replay.

### ModSecurity (CRS)

- CRS paranoia level 1-2: content-type mutation + junk padding usually sufficient.
- CRS level 3-4: requires payload fragmentation across chunked transfer encoding or multipart boundaries.
- `X-Original-URL` and `X-Rewrite-URL` bypass CRS path-based rules on Nginx/Apache reverse-proxy setups.
- SSTI payload `{{7*7}}` blocked by CRS rule 941xxx → encode as `{%raw%}{{7*7}}{%endraw%}` or submit via JSON body.

### Akamai

- "Reference #" in response = Kona Site Defender block.
- Akamai trusts `True-Client-IP` header on misconfigured origins — inject internal IP there.
- Rate limiting: distributed across PoPs. Rotating IPs alone insufficient; combine with jitter (100–2500 ms).
- Slow-rate evasion: `Connection: keep-alive` + 1-2 s delay between requests.

### AWS WAF

- Rule groups (AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet) block common SQLi/XSS payloads in query strings and body.
- Body inspection is capped at 8 KB by default → junk padding above 8 KB moves payload outside inspection window.
- `X-Forwarded-For` is NOT trusted by AWS WAF natively; works if target sits behind ALB with forwarding configured.
- Method mutation effective: AWS WAF does not inspect OPTIONS/TRACE body by default.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

```
1. IDENTIFY WAF
   curl -si https://TARGET/ | grep -iE "server|x-powered-by|cf-ray|x-cache|x-amz-cf|via|akamai"
   wafw00f https://TARGET/

2. SELECT BYPASS LAYER
   403 hard block         → start with IP spoofing headers + UA rotation
   429 rate limit         → add jitter (random 0.1–2.5 s) + IP rotation
   JS challenge           → use Playwright stealth or replay cf_clearance
   Payload-specific block → content-type mutation + junk padding

3. WRAP REQUEST
   Apply headers from payloads/headers_spoofing.yaml (rotate IP from pool)
   Set UA from payloads/user_agents_2025.txt (rotate per request)
   Set realistic Referer
   If POST blocked → try PUT or PATCH (payloads/method_mutation.yaml)
   If body inspected → prepend junk padding (8 KB default)

4. RETRY
   Re-send probe with wrapped request
   If still blocked → increment junk padding, try next method mutation,
                      escalate to chunked transfer encoding fragmentation

5. CONFIRM BYPASS
   200 / 302 → bypass successful, proceed with full exploit
   Still 403  → log response headers, check WAF fingerprint, pivot technique
```

## Jitter Config (from EvasionEngine)

| Parameter    | Default | Notes                              |
|--------------|---------|------------------------------------|
| jitter_min   | 100 ms  | Minimum delay between requests     |
| jitter_max   | 2500 ms | Maximum delay; tune per WAF policy |
| rotate_ua    | true    | Rotate UA every request            |
| proxychains  | false   | Enable for full IP rotation        |
