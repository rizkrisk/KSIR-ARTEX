# Google Dorking — Passive OSINT

Passive reconnaissance using Google advanced search operators to enumerate exposed assets, credentials, misconfigurations, and injectable parameters without touching the target directly.

Source library: GHDB (Exploit-DB), bug bounty reports, red-team playbooks. 185+ dorks across 11 categories.

---

## Prerequisites

- Target domain(s) — e.g. `example.com`
- Optionally: company or brand name for cloud/paste/repo searches (used in `cloud_storage` and `credentials` categories where the dork uses `"{target}"` as a quoted keyword rather than a `site:` operator)

---

## Input format

All payload files use `{target}` as the substitution placeholder. Replace with the bare domain (no `https://`, no trailing slash) before running.

```
{target} → example.com
```

For categories where the dork is a global search (cloud_storage, credentials — lines not prefixed with `site:{target}`), `{target}` is a quoted keyword: substitute with the company name, domain, or brand string.

---

## Categories

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Substitute target

```bash
TARGET="example.com"
sed "s/{target}/$TARGET/g" payloads/sensitive_files.txt > /tmp/dorks_sensitive.txt
```

Or substitute inline per query. For cloud/credential global-search dorks, use the company name or domain as the keyword.

### Step 2 — Run each category

Paste dorks manually into Google, or automate with:
- `googler` (CLI, no API key)
- SerpAPI / ValueSERP (rate-limited, API key)
- `dork-cli`

Rate-limit: pause 5–10 s between queries. Use VPN or rotating proxies to avoid CAPTCHA blocks. Do not run all 185+ dorks in one session without jitter.

### Step 3 — Triage results

For each result that returns a live page or file:
1. Record the dork, URL, and response summary.
2. Classify by finding type (credential / config / source code / admin panel / vuln param / etc.).
3. Note whether the finding is confirmed exposed (200 OK with real content) or blocked (403/404/login wall).

### Step 4 — Feed into ARTEX asset store

Use ARTEX `insert_assets` to register discovered assets:

| Finding type | Asset kind |
|---|---|
| New subdomain | `domain` |
| API endpoint | `endpoint` |
| Admin panel URL | `endpoint` |
| Credential/key | `secret` (mark sensitive) |
| Cloud bucket | `storage` |
| Vulnerable parameter | `vuln_param` |

---

## Output format

Results as a JSON array:

```json
[
  {
    "category": "sensitive_files",
    "dork": "site:example.com ext:env \"DB_PASSWORD\"",
    "url": "https://example.com/config/.env",
    "status": 200,
    "notes": "Confirmed: DB_PASSWORD, APP_KEY visible in plaintext"
  },
  {
    "category": "cloud_storage",
    "dork": "site:s3.amazonaws.com \"example.com\"",
    "url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/example-backups/dump.sql",
    "status": 200,
    "notes": "Public bucket, contains database dump 2024-11"
  }
]
```

Fields: `category`, `dork` (with target substituted), `url`, `status` (HTTP code or `blocked`), `notes`.

## Key finding types and severity

| Finding | Severity | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `.env` with DB/AWS credentials | Critical | Immediate credential rotation notification |
| `.git` directory exposed | Critical | `git-dumper` to extract full repo history |
| AWS key with `AKIA` prefix | Critical | `aws sts get-caller-identity` to check scope |
| SSH private key (`BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY`) | Critical | Identify what systems it opens |
| Admin panel without auth wall | High | Attempt default credentials (next skill) |
| Swagger/OpenAPI spec exposed | High | Feed into `api-security` skill |
| Directory listing on `/uploads` | Medium | Enumerate for further sensitive files |
| Stack trace / SQL error string | Medium | Technology fingerprint + potential SQLi |
| Staging/UAT subdomain | Medium | Often lower WAF/auth posture than prod |
| Injectable parameter pattern | Low–High | Feed into `sqli-to-rce` or `ssrf-to-rce` skill |
| Pastebin/GitHub credential leak | High | Check if keys are still active |

## AI-enhanced dork generation

When the static library does not cover a niche technology stack or the target has a specific context (cloud-native, specific SaaS, unusual CMS), use the following prompt with an LLM to generate 15 custom dorks:

```
Generate 15 advanced and creative Google Dorks for the target: {target}

Requirements:
- Use advanced operators: site:, inurl:, intitle:, ext:, filetype:, intext:
- Focus on:
  * Sensitive files (.env, .git, .sql, .bak, .key)
  * Exposed admin panels and dashboards
  * Unauthenticated APIs (Swagger, GraphQL, actuator)
  * Misconfigured cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob)
  * Parameters vulnerable to SQLi/LFI/SSRF
  * Credentials in code repos (GitHub, GitLab)
  * Stack traces and error pages that reveal technology stack
- Include dorks for forgotten subdomains (dev, staging, UAT)
- Prioritize 2024-2026 techniques
- Avoid generic dorks — be specific and creative

Additional context: {context}

Format: one dork per line, no numbering, no explanation.
```

Parse output: accept lines longer than 10 characters that do not start with `#` or `-`.

## Orchestrator recon prompt integration

The following snippet is the dorking section injected into the Orchestrator RECON phase prompt. Include it verbatim when building a full recon plan:

```
5. Passive Google Dorking — execute these dorks in Google:
   - site:{target} ext:env | ext:log | ext:sql | ext:bak
   - site:{target} inurl:admin | inurl:login | inurl:panel
   - site:*.{target} -www  (subdomain enumeration)
   - site:s3.amazonaws.com "{target}"  (cloud leak hunt)
   - site:github.com "{target}" password | secret | token
   - site:{target} inurl:".git"  (source code leak)
   - site:{target} intitle:"index of /"  (directory listing)
   - site:{target} inurl:"?id=" | inurl:"?file="  (SQLi/LFI params)
```

---

## Integration with other ARTEX skills

| Next skill | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `api-security` | Swagger/OpenAPI spec found exposed |
| `sqli-to-rce` | Injectable `?id=`, `?cat=`, `?item=` parameters found |
| `ssrf-to-rce` | Injectable `?url=`, `?dest=`, `?fetch=` parameters found |
| `osint-identity` | Admin panel found — feed URL for credential correlation |
| `codeaudit` | `.git` repo dumped — audit extracted source |
| `file-upload-weaponize` | `/wp-content/uploads/` directory listing with write access |

---

## Tooling

| Tool | Use | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `googler` | CLI Google search without API key | Rate-limited by Google; use with VPN |
| SerpAPI | Programmatic, JSON output | Paid; accurate, high rate limits |
| `dork-cli` | Batch dork runner | Open-source, supports delay |
| `git-dumper` | Dump exposed `.git` directories | `git-dumper https://target/.git/ ./repo` |
| `trufflehog` | Scan dumped repos for secrets | Feeds into credential findings |
| `cloud_enum` | Cloud bucket permutation hunting | Complements cloud_storage dorks |

---

## Notes

- Google dorking is purely passive — no direct requests to the target.
- Results depend on Google's index freshness; recently exposed files may not be indexed yet.
- `combined_advanced.txt` dorks use OR/NOT boolean chaining — most effective for bulk hunting but consume query quota faster.
- The `cloud_storage` category queries third-party services (S3, GitHub, Pastebin) rather than `site:{target}` — these run without rate-limit concern from the target but may trigger Google rate-limits.
- `SKIP` and `no results` for a category is not evidence the target is clean — Google may not have indexed the exposure.
